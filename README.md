#BioRetro

This is my final project for Hackbright Academy's Winter 2015 engineering fellowship. It's designed to pull in heart rate data (in BPM), and assess based on a given user's baseline which days of the week tend to be more stressful than others. 

PLEASE NOTE: This tool is intended for users' own personal introspection and heath maintenence (sort of like a mental health peak flow meter, if you've ever used one of those doodads they give asthma patients.) It IS NOT intended to be used during a sprint retrospective meeting unless everyone on the team is comfortable sharing personal biofeedback metrics, which not everyone may want to do. 

It's also currently under active development, so things will change quickly! Check back for the final product.
